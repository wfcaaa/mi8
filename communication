communication problem simulator and driver:
case 1: unable to register (DEVICE_ASYNC, DEVICE_ASYNC_VERSION, udp).Error: cannot open message queue 
in this case , we can now know that the message queue resource is exhausted, even if we kill the process which occupy the resource 
of message queue, However,sometimes, it can not release resource immediately. so when customer encounter this case, reboot is the directly
solution.

case 2: srq blocked, if ordinary user permission launch tcct and root permission launch simulator, the SRQ sent from simulator will be
        blocked, the root cause is that, vxii11 server and vxi11 client communcation with each other by meassage queues. data written to
        the messae queues by root permission, the ordinary permission can read it. so the solution is that launching tcct and simulaor
        whit the ordinary permission.
